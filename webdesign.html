        <h2>Wordpress</h2>
        <p>
            WordPress first saw the light of day on May 27, 2003. The founders are Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little.
            WordPress can be referred to as an online, open source site building tool based on PHP and MySQL programming
            languages. In more advanced terms it is called a content management system (CMS).
            When WordPress was first launched it had several users but over time grew into the biggest and most popular
            CMS in the world. Today, WordPress is powering over 75 million websites.
            Research carried out in 2020 shows that this content management system is used by more than 26% of the 10
            million best-ranking sites.
            personal websites or portfolios, ranging to e-shops, knowledge bases or job boards.
            Another factor is that WordPress is completely free and supports all hosting platforms with PHP and MySQL.
            On top of that, this CMS is constantly updated with new versions that improve security, include new features
            and improve overall performance.
            Last, but not least, WordPress has a huge community with dedicated forums and discussions all over the
            internet. The amount of data that is available and thousands of WordPress tutorials also make WordPress one
            of the easiest to use content management systems out there.

        <h2>Adobe Photoshop</h2>
        <p>
            Adobe Photoshop, or simply Photoshop, is a graphics editing program developed and published by Adobe
            Systems.
            It is the current market leader for commercial bitmap and image manipulation software, and is the flagship
            product of Adobe Systems. It has been described as "an industry standard for graphics professionals" and was
            one of the early "killer applications" on the Macintosh,
            later also for the PC. Adobe's 2005 "Creative Suite" rebranding led to Adobe Photoshop 8's renaming to Adobe
            Photoshop CS. Thus, Adobe Photoshop CS4 is the 11th major release of Adobe Photoshop. The CS rebranding also
            resulted in Adobe offering numerous software packages containing multiple Adobe programs for a reduced
            price.
            Adobe Photoshop is included in most of Adobe's Creative Suite offerings.
            Photoshop has strong ties with other Adobe software for media editing, animation, and authoring. The .PSD
            (Photoshop Document), Photoshop's native format, stores an image with support for most imaging options
            available in Photoshop. These include layers with masks, color spaces, ICC profiles, transparency, text,
            alpha channels and spot colors, clipping paths, and duotone settings.
            This is in contrast to many other file formats (e.g. .EPS or .GIF) that restrict content to provide
            streamlined, predictable functionality. Photoshop's popularity means that the .PSD format is widely used,
            and it is supported to some extent by most competing software.
            The .PSD file format can be exported to and from Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro, and After Effects,
            to make professional standard DVDs and provide non-linear editing and special effects services, such as
            backgrounds, textures, and so on, for television, film, and the Web. Photoshop is a pixel-based image
            editor, unlike Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw, which is a vector-based image editor.
            Photoshop can utilize the color models RGB (red, green, blue), lab, CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, key),
            grayscale, binary bitmap, and duotone. Photoshop has the ability to read and write raster and vector image
            formats such as .EPS, .PNG, .GIF (Graphic Interchange Format), .JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), and
            Adobe Fireworks.

        <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
        <p>
            Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications.
            It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web
            sites.
            It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays,
            the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens
            (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones).
            All thanks to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to
            be an open-source project.
            Faster and Easier Web-Development.
            It creates Platform-independent web-pages.
            It creates Responsive Web-pages.
            It designed to be responsive to mobile devices too.

        <h2>WIX</h2>
        <p>
            Wix.com Ltd. is an Israeli software limited company that provides cloud-based web development services to
            the users. It permits users to build HTML5 websites and mobile sites using online drag and drop features. It
            was developed by Nadav Abrahami, Giora Kaplan, and Avishai Abrahami in 2006.
            By using Wix-developed and third-party applications, users may include social plugins, online marketing,
            e-mail marketing, e-commerce, communication forms, and community forums on their websites. The Wix developer
            is based on a freemium business model, gaining its revenue through the premium upgrades.
            It is very easy to use and learn. It offers the drag and drop interface tools by which we can choose and
            customize elements on the website. We are not required to learn or write any code for this.
            It has many good visual templates that are responsive and can be further customized, such as rearranging
            elements, design, etc. It has one disadvantage that we can change it in the future once we have selected one
            template.
